This program is quite interesting. Given a 10 latex files, this program is made to read each of 
them and then create a new file and write to it in a specific format. If the file is invalid 
or one of the entries is formatted incorectly, FileInvalidException is thrown, and the file 
does not get created. This is why some files are not present.
