This program is complex. It opens a file contianing a few cellphone objects. The program
reads from the text file and creates a cellphone object based on the contents of the file. Then,
through the use of linked lists, creates a custom linked list containing cellphone objects. The 
purpose of this program was to practice and solidify my understanding of linked lists.
